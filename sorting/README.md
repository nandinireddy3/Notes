classification of sorting algorithms:

1- Time Complexity
2- Space Complexity
    In-place, constant memory
    Merge sort -> memory usage grows with input size
3- Stability
    If elements with same property preserves the relative order of sorting algorithm.
4- Internal sort vs External Sort
5- Recursive vs Non-recursive sort
